## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In the past 20 years data and analytics have changed the sports landscape. Specifically in baseball where there are countless stats and a large sample size the way teams are constructed is changing. You can see this change in the way teams spend their money, and over the years they have prioritized different stats when signing players. It would be interesting to look into the changes in what statistics the highest paid players had in common and who may have been underpaid and underrarted when they played.  

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset is a collection of the season statistics of Major League Baseball teams and players from 1871-2020. The data is supplied by the Chadwick Baseball Bureau, which is the historical statistical data provider of Baseball-Reference. This open data provided by the bureau is a part of their mission to document the history of baseball. The dataset contains statistics for batting, pitching, and fielding for the regular and post-season. It also contains salaries and other niche statistics. The people dataset is the Chadwick Baseball Register, a collection of people who have been involved in a high level of baseball as a player, manager, or umpire. The data is updated once a year in the offseason with the previous season's stats, except for the register which is updated more often. The data is in the form of counting stats only and any averages or advanced stats must be calculated manually. Players within the data are labeled with a unique playerID, the player's names and playerID's are all listed in the register. The register also contains the cities, countries, and dates of people's births and deaths.
