## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In the past 20 years data and analytics have changed the sports landscape. Specifically in baseball where there are countless stats and a large sample size the way teams are constructed is changing. You can see this change in the way teams spend their money, and over the years they have prioritized different stats when signing players. It would be interesting to look into the changes in what statistics the highest paid players had in common and who may have been underpaid and underrarted when they played. 
Statistics can be used in many ways.
To Select players - 
The breakdown of statistics in order to advance a teams roster is a theory that has been explored more ever since the story of how the 2002 Oakland athletics took this new approach to the game and made it to the world series finals as a "low class" low budget team. By analyzing statistics they were able to replace star players for much cheaper ones that no-one else wanted based off of theories.
To advise players of situations - 
By storing all of this data about every player allows coaches and players to adjust on the field to every player that comes up to bat. For example, using data a pitcher can understand what pitches a certain batter hits well and doesn't and where when he makes contact the ball goes. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset is a collection of the season statistics of Major League Baseball teams and players from 1871-2020. The data is supplied by the Chadwick Baseball Bureau, which is the historical statistical data provider of Baseball-Reference. This open data provided by the bureau is a part of their mission to document the history of baseball. The dataset contains statistics for batting, pitching, and fielding for the regular and post-season. It also contains salaries and other niche statistics. The people dataset is the Chadwick Baseball Register, a collection of people who have been involved in a high level of baseball as a player, manager, or umpire. The data is updated once a year in the offseason with the previous season's stats, except for the register which is updated more often. The data is in the form of counting stats only and any averages or advanced stats must be calculated manually. Players within the data are labeled with a unique playerID, the player's names and playerID's are all listed in the register. The register also contains the cities, countries, and dates of people's births and deaths.
