We will communicate with each other via our groupchat on Snapchat
We will be respecful of other team members and any questions asked. We will do our best to help each other to answer those questions.
We will comminicate with each other when we have conflicting schedules and need to meet to discuss the project - this will be before any project meetings so the other team members are aware.
We will bring issues/concerns forward and use the team consensus for decision making.
We will actively participate in each Project Milestone equally, unless prior decisions have been made if one/three has a very busy week (or a different reason).
Any violations to the conduct will be brought up immediately in the group. A second violation and any onwards will be brought to the professors attention.
